# iRODS Rule Engine Plugin - Logical Quotas

Allows administrators to track and enforce limits on the number of bytes and data objects in a collection.

The following example demonstrates monitoring a collection, setting a quota on the maximum number of data
objects, and then violating that quota.
```bash
$ ils
/tempZone/home/rods:
  foo
  bar
$ irule -r irods_rule_engine_plugin-irods_rule_language-instance 'logical_quotas_start_monitoring_collection("/tempZone/home/rods")' null ruleExecOut
$ imeta ls -C .

## Requirements
- iRODS v4.2.9
- irods-dev package
- irods-runtime package
- irods-externals-boost package
- irods-externals-json package

## Compiling
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/irods/irods_rule_engine_plugin_logical_quotas
$ cd irods_rule_engine_plugin_logical_quotas
$ git checkout 4-2-stable
$ mkdir _build && cd _build
$ cmake -GNinja ..
$ ninja package
```
After compiling, you should now have a `deb` or `rpm` package with a name similar to the following:
```bash
irods-rule-engine-plugin-logical-quotas-<plugin_version>-<os>-<arch>.<deb|rpm>
```

## Installing
Ubuntu:
```bash
$ sudo dpkg -i irods-rule-engine-plugin-logical-quotas-*.deb
```
CentOS:
```bash
$ su -c yum localinstall irods-rule-engine-plugin-logical-quotas-*.rpm
```
If the installation was successful, you should now have a new shared library. The full path to the library
should be similar to the following:
```
<irods_lib_home>/plugins/rule_engines/libirods_rule_engine_plugin-logical_quotas.so
```

## Configuration
To enable, prepend the following plugin configuration to the list of rule engines in `/etc/irods/server_config.json`. 

The plugin configuration must be placed ahead of all plugins that define any of the following PEPs:
- pep_api_data_obj_close_post
- pep_api_data_obj_close_pre
- pep_api_data_obj_copy_post
- pep_api_data_obj_copy_pre
- pep_api_data_obj_create_and_stat_post
- pep_api_data_obj_create_and_stat_pre
- pep_api_data_obj_create_post
- pep_api_data_obj_create_pre
- pep_api_data_obj_open_and_stat_pre
- pep_api_data_obj_open_pre
- pep_api_data_obj_put_post
- pep_api_data_obj_put_pre
- pep_api_data_obj_rename_post
- pep_api_data_obj_rename_pre
- pep_api_data_obj_unlink_ppost
- pep_api_data_obj_unlink_pre
- pep_api_replica_close_post
- pep_api_replica_close_pre
- pep_api_replica_open_pre
- pep_api_rm_coll_post
- pep_api_rm_coll_pre

Even though this plugin will process PEPs first due to its positioning, subsequent Rule Engine Plugins (REP) will 
still be allowed to process the same PEPs without any issues.
```javascript
"rule_engines": [
    {
        "instance_name": "irods_rule_engine_plugin-logical_quotas-instance",
        "plugin_name": "irods_rule_engine_plugin-logical_quotas",
        "plugin_specific_configuration": {
            "namespace": "irods::logical_quotas",
            "metadata_attribute_names": {
                "maximum_number_of_data_objects": "maximum_number_of_data_objects",
                "maximum_size_in_bytes": "maximum_size_in_bytes",
                "total_number_of_data_objects": "total_number_of_data_objects",
                "total_size_in_bytes": "total_size_in_bytes"
            }
        }
    },
    
    // ... Previously installed rule engine plugin configs ...
]
```

## How To Use
The following operations are supported:
- logical_quotas_count_total_number_of_data_objects
- logical_quotas_count_total_size_in_bytes
- logical_quotas_get_collection_status
- logical_quotas_recalculate_totals
- logical_quotas_set_maximum_number_of_data_objects
- logical_quotas_set_maximum_size_in_bytes
- logical_quotas_start_monitoring_collection
- logical_quotas_stop_monitoring_collection
- logical_quotas_unset_maximum_number_of_data_objects
- logical_quotas_unset_maximum_size_in_bytes
- logical_quotas_unset_total_number_of_data_objects
- logical_quotas_unset_total_size_in_bytes

### Invoking operations via the Plugin
To invoke an operation through the plugin, JSON must be passed using the following structure:
```javascript
{
    // One of the operations listed above.
    "operation": "<value>",

    // The absolute logical path of an existing collection.
    "collection": "<value>",

    // This value is only used by "logical_quotas_set_maximum_number_of_data_objects" and
    // "logical_quotas_set_maximum_size_in_bytes". This is expected to be an integer
    // passed in as a string.
    "value": "<value>"
}
```

Use `irule` to execute an operation. For example, we can start monitoring a collection by running the following:
```bash
$ irule -r irods_rule_engine_plugin-logical_quotas-instance '{"operation": "logical_quotas_start_monitoring_collection", "collection": "/tempZone/home/rods"}' null ruleExecOut
```

We can set a maximum limit on the number of data objects by running the following:
```bash
$ irule -r irods_rule_engine_plugin-logical_quotas-instance '{"operation": "logical_quotas_set_maximum_number_of_data_objects", "collection": "/tempZone/home/rods", "value": "100"}' null ruleExecOut
```
If no errors occurred, then `/tempZone/home/rods` will only be allowed to contain 100 data objects. However, Logical
Quotas does not guarantee that the numbers produced perfectly reflect the total number of data objects under a collection.
Logical Quotas only provides a relative value assuming there are many clients accessing the system simultaneously.

To help with this situation, `logical_quotas_recalculate_totals` is provided. This operation can be scheduled
to run periodically to keep the numbers as accurate as possible.

You can also retrieve the quota status for a collection as JSON by invoking `logical_quotas_get_collection_status`, for example:
```bash
$ irule -r irods_rule_engine_plugin-logical_quotas-instance '{"operation": "logical_quotas_get_collection_status", "collection": "/tempZone/home/rods"}' null ruleExecOut
```
The JSON output will be printed to the terminal and have the following structure:
```javascript
{
    <maximum_number_of_data_objects_key>: "#",
    <maximum_size_in_bytes_key>: "#",
    <total_number_of_data_objects_key>: "#",
    <total_size_in_bytes_key>: "#"
}
```
The **keys** are derived from the **namespace** and **metadata_attribute_names** defined by the plugin configuration.

### Invoking operations via the Native Rule Language
Here, we demonstrate how to start monitoring a collection just like in the section above.
```bash
$ irule -r irods_rule_engine_plugin-irods_rule_language-instance 'logical_quotas_start_monitoring_collection(*col)' '*col=/tempZone/home/rods' ruleExecOut
```

## Stream Operations
With previous iterations of this plugin, changes in data were tracked and checked for violations across all
stream-based operations in real-time. However, with the introduction of intermediate replicas and logical locking
in iRODS v4.2.9, maintaining this behavior became complex. Due to the complexity, the handling of quotas has been
relaxed. The most important changes are as follows:
- Quotas are no longer checked, enforced, or updated during write and seek operations.
- Once a quota has been violated, opening a data object for writing will fail.
- Only data objects with replicas marked as good in the catalog are counted towards quota totals.

These changes have the following effects:
- The plugin allows stream-based writes to violate the maximum bytes quota once.
- Subsequent stream-based creates and writes will be denied until the quotas are out of violation.
